# Project Name
Jquery Server Calculator

## Description
Duration: 4.5 hours 

This project has all of the logic on server.js. We get our info from inputs and put the info into an object to send to the server via .ajax requests. From there we have our logic to solve the calculations. The calculations including the answer is pushed into an array with all the previous calculation. The array of past calculations and the most recent answer is sent back to client.js so the info can be appended to the DOM.
